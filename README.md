# Cheating Behavior Analysis in PUBG: Homophily & Social Contagion Simulation

This repository contains a Python program that analyzes social behaviors and interactions within a multiplayer online gaming environment. Specifically, the focus is on understanding the phenomenon of cheating, where players adopt unapproved software to gain unfair advantages. The program simulates player interactions and observes the likelihood of players forming associations with other cheaters, as well as the impact of interactions with cheaters on non-cheating players' likelihood to adopt cheating behaviors.

Key features include:

Simulation of alternative game scenarios to assess player team compositions and interactions.
Analysis of player behaviors when exposed to cheaters, including whether observing or being killed by cheaters increases the likelihood of adopting cheating behavior.
Comparison of observed outcomes with randomized simulations to assess whether certain behaviors are more likely than would occur by chance.
The program is built using fundamental Python data types and modules, focusing on core computational thinking concepts such as loops, conditionals, functions, and performance optimization. The code is modular, well-structured, and designed with flexibility for potential future analyses on similar datasets.
